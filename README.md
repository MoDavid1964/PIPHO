# PIPHO 2022

### About

PIPHO is a planned upcoming competition which aims to promote an interest in physics among members of the PSHS community. The competition will take place during YMSAT of SY2021-2022 and will be facilitated by various members of the PYHS.

### The CMS

The content management system (CMS) for PIPHO 2022 is custom-built and in-development. If you wish to contribute to the project, contact one of the developers listed below.

You can currently visit the site at http://pipho.000webhostapp.com/, although it will be migrated to a better hosting platform as soon as the site is finalized.

##### Initial Plan

The CMS manages two types of user account: admin accounts and participant accounts. The former possesses priviliges which allow them to modify the database storing various resources and PIPHO data. The latter are users taking part in the competition, and have access only to the lower-level functionalities of the site. Note that a teaming system is yet to be implemented for the site.

##### Progress

* ##### v0.1.0

Currently, a rudimentary UI has been implemented, and the login system functions as needed. Users may also register, although input validation has not been implemented.
Restrictions on accessing admin-level functionality has also been implemented, and user sessions function with basic access to the site. However, logging out is currently impossible.

### Problems

The problems included in the competition will be drafted by members of the PYHS. However, contributors may refer problems to any one of our members; these may then be included after further perusal.
